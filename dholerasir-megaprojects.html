It is envisaged that the new industry cluster to be developed along the spine would considerably benefit with central linkage. It will also act as catalyst to other developments in the region in general and that of SIR in particular. This is also a part of master plan submitted to central govt. for DMIC road connectivity.

                <p>The existing airport of Ahmedabad has emerged as one with highest annual growth in traffic and will get saturated much before the year 2020. The expansion of Ahmedabad airport is difficult due to various reasons. Under the circumstances, a new international airport is required to cater the future traffic.</p>
                <p>While assessing the potential and requirements of the Dholera SIR, Government envisaged a tremendous need for a Greenfield International Airport in its vicinity. The level of economic activities in the SIR backed by enormous domestic and foreign investment shall need a world class modern International Airport in this region. Therefore state has included the development of an International Airport in the list of “Early Bird Projects” in consultation with Department of Industrial Promotion and Policy. GoG has also signed an MoU with the Delhi Metro Industrial Corridor Development Company in this regard.</p>
                <p>The state Government identified the location for the proposed Airport and has earmarked the land. A parcel of Government land and measuring aroximately 1700 hectors has been reserved in the triangle of village Pachham-Valinda-Pipli of Taluka Dhandhuka Dist Ahmedabad in the name of Gujarat Industrial Corridor Company Ltd (GICC), which would work as a project development agency for DMIC. The site is about 80 kms from Ahmedabad and around 20 kms from Dholera SIR. In addition to the SIR and Ahmedabad city, this location is also ideally placed vis-à-vis the cities like Nadiyad, Bhavnagar, Vadodara and Rajkot. The details of land made available for the said Air Port is shown in the table below:</p>

It is about 100 kms and is proposed as elevated metro. This will provide faster movement and even otherwise important for new international air port. The project is having a longer gestation period and requires to be taken up quickly. The metro is also aroved under DMIC master plan by the central govt.</p>
            <p>In one of the meetings with secretary DI, during his visit to Gandhinagar it was thought of high speed rail corridor on this route. It is related to pre- feasibility study being carried out by the ministry of railways for Pune-Mumbai-Ahmedbad high speed rail corridor. The govt. of Gujarat has requested the MoR to check up the possibility to extend it upto Dholera via GIFT near Gandhinagar.</p>
            <p>In the meantime the study work has been assigned to IL&FS by GIDB for Metro rail. In fact on 29th August 2008, GIDB has re-aointed IL&FS Infrastructure development Corporation for undertaking project advisory services for the Ahmedabad Metro project with the scope of services leading to selection of concessionaire. Again, on 1st September 2008, GIDB also aointed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for consultancy services for preparing the Detailed Project Report for the Ahmedabad Metro Extension from Gandhinagar to GIFT city.</p>
            <p>The Government of Gujarat is also keen on considering the high speed rail feasibility study with central government (MoR) and other state provided the same could encompass the Dholera SIR and GIFT region.</p>
            <p>A Steering Committee was formed with the aroval of honorable Minister of State dated 5th September, 2008 under the chairmanship of Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department to review and monitor the progress of the studies to be carried out for Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project.</p>
            <p>In a special meeting held under the chairmanship of PS, UDD, to review the progress of Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project on 15th December, 2008, it was decided to form immediately an SPV under 100% GoG owned Company with initial objectives of land acquisition of the metro corridor, stations and depots, shifting of utilities and interacting with both state as well as central government for finalising funding pattern. A meeting was called under the chairmanship of Principal Secretary (Expenditure), Finance Department to review the structure of SPV. A presentation was done by CEO- GIDB and it was decided to go ahead with the formation of SPV with an initial paid up capital of Rupees 10 Crores and authorised capital of Rupees 200 Crores.</p>
            <h6>The phase I corridor would include the following routes of 61.55 kms as an elevated metro rail system:</h6>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Industrial Mega parks in DSIR</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Industrial Mega Parks are the central feature of the Dholera Special Investment Region (DSIR), a major new economic hub located 100 km south of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The total industrial area within the DSIR is split into a number of Mega Industrial Park / SEZ which cover a gross land area of 10,000 ha. Industrial Mega Park 1 (the Phase 1 of the overall Industrial Mega Parks) covers an area of about 3,000 hector gross land area. The market assessment forecast a total demand for over 9,500 ha (net) of industrial land in the DSIR over the 30 year plan period, which equates to a gross land area, including roads and infrastructure and other supported facilities, of about 10,500 hector to be alloted for industrial and logistics use. Employment in the industrial sectors will lay the economic foundations of the DSIR and generate about 313,000 “base” jobs, which will then generate further jobs in the service sector. Overall employment in the DSIR is expected to reach over 800,000 jobs in the plan period. Reserve areas are earmarked in the Concept Plan should additional industrial land be required.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The spatial strategy proposed for the Industrial Parks of the DSIR is based upon seven planning principles as follows:</b></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Location of the main industrial lands either side of the expressway in order to facilitate speedy access to and from the DSIR to the DMIC and key ports.</p>
            <p>The early development phase is sited largely on Government owned land in order to speed up the release of land to the fi rst industrial anchor tenants.</p>
            <p>Grade separated junctions on the expressway giving direct access from the highway to the main industrial areas, allowing goods vehicles to avoid entering into the residential or commercial areas of the city.</p>
            <p>A “box” grid of arterial and collector roads linking the industrial areas together. This box is also the main loop for public transports ensuring the industrial workforce have adequate access to their place of employment via rapid transit routes.</p>
            <p>Extending the railway line through the industrial lands in order to maximize the potential for rail based freight, with direct rail access available for a number of major development sites.</p>
            <p>Allocation of a logistics zone and inland container port in the centre of the industrial areas with both road and rail access.</p>
            <p>Easy access to major commercial nodes. The huge demand for industrial land in the DSIR means that it is necessary to divide the industrial land provision into a series of separate “mega” industrial zones. This division will ensure that each industrial area does not become too large and will remain easily accessible to residential areas and commercial facilities. It also makes it easier to provide infrastructure in an incremental and phased manner and provides a degree of flexibility in land use provision, as well as ensuring that the industrial land can be managed under a variety of industrial estate property models. The development of industrial land has been phased over a 30 year period in accordance with the overall phasing strategy for the DSIR</p>
            <h5>Phasing</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Phase 1</b> <br>
                    This area is developed to the east of the expressway and is intended to be the first of the mega parks to be developed. It covers the highest concentration of Government owned land in the DSIR. The strategy provides land for each of the 8 industrial sectors targeted for the DSIR and is designed to be large enough to accommodate land required by the DSIR for the fi rst 10 years of growth. This mega park will also have a close relationship with the Phase 1 township area which will also be developed during this stage.
                    <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Phase 2</b> <br>
                    This phase will witness the most significant growth of the industrial zones and will expand naturally out from the Phase1 development area. Industrial uses will expand east of the expressway and further to the south and centre of the DSIR. As with Phase 1, this phase will encompass land to accommodate all of the targeted industrial sectors.<br><br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Phase 3</b> <br>
                    Phase 3 developments will be located in the south western quadrant of the city, furthest from the centre. The area is nevertheless still well connected to the expressway and the rest of the city, including the housing areas also schedule for development in this phase<br><br>

            <p>Logistics play a citadel role in the modern intelligent sully chain management. It is defined as the broad range of activities concerned with effective and efficient movement of semi-finished or finished product from one business to another or from manufacturer/distributor/retailer to the end consumer. It relates to freight transportation, warehousing material handling, protective packaging inventory control, order processing, and marketing, forecasting and other value added services.</p>
            <p>With a view to provide efficient logistics services, Indian Railways has embarked into a massive investment to create dedicated freight corridor between Delhi and Mumbai (called Western DFC) and Ludhiana and Howrah (called Eastern DFC), which could provide high speed, heavy pay load only for freight traffic. Western DFC passes through most high density transport arteries of the country i.e. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar pradesh with a route length of 1483km.</p>
            <p>Gujarat shares 38% of the route covering Valsad, Surat, Vadodara, Anand, Ahmedabad, Mehsana, Palanpur. This corridor is expected to carry predominantly, container traffic, bulk and break-bulk cargo. To suort this infrastructure, DMIC Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, Special Economic Zones, MMLPs Investment Regions, Industrial Area are likely to be set up contiguous to Western DFC in the coming years.</p>
            <p>MMLP is the refined form of Logistics Park where various value added services are rendered in addition to rail/road based transportation. It is now-a-days a globally identified sully management and known by different names in different countries.</p>
            <p>As the economic barriers among European Union were dislodged, it was essential to rationalize the transport and logistics structure by revitalizing the railways, promoting maritime and rationally integrating all modes of transport. In China, the shifting of closed economy to globalised economy enhances the need to develop a sound logistics industry.</p>
            <p>Cushman and Wakefield have published a report “Logistics Industry- Real Estates’ New Power House” which avers that Indian logistics industry is expected to grow annually @ 15 to 25%. Major cities like Kolkata Mumbai, Chennai-Hyderabad, have identified locations for Logistics Park.</p>

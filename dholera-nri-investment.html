            <p>A person resident in India who is a citizen of Pakistan or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Afghanistan or China or Iran or Nepal or Bhutan is governed by the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property in India) Regulations, 2000. He would require prior approval of the RBI for acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India even though he is resident in India. Such requests are considered by the RBI in consultation with the Government in India.</p> <br>
            <p>Indian regulators are known to modify laws and regulations with nagging frequency. The best of investments decisions suffer due to sudden swings in regulations. The provisions related to foreign investment in real estate in India have been relatively stable and no pejorative changes have been effected therein in the recent past. That has perhaps facilitated the aggressive alteration of India’s skyline, due to large and outstanding building projects funded interalia, by foreign funds. It has not yet fully addressed the backlog of deficit in demand for space. Such long term deficit will always attract investment therein and returns will follow. So will NRIs.
